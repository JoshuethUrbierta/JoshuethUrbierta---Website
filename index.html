        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business EconomicsðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I'm a 2nd year student at UCR studying business economics. Iâ€™m also a first-generation college student and live in the city of Compton, California but I was born and raised in Hawthorne, California. After college, I want to pursue a career as a wealth manager or some type of financial advisor within a firm. Then, I'd like to move to the city of New York or Toronto, Canada for a few years to experience a change in the people, culture, and environment. Eventually, Iâ€™d like to move to a few different cities around the United States to figure out whether or not Iâ€™d like to live in Los Angeles for the rest of my life or not. I would be open to moving to somewhere out the country, specifically in Europe.<br><br>

        I am currently living on campus at the Lothian dorms next to the Glen Mor market. Next year, I am plan on moving into a house with some of my closest friends here at UCR. Back at home though, I live with both of my parents, 3 siblings, and 3 pets. I have a younger brother who just turned 18 years old, and 2 baby sisters who are 6 and 7 years old. Then, I have a cat whose name is Jasper, a cane corse whose name is Jazzy, and a german shepherd mixed with a husky whose name is Jordan. A fun fact about my family is that all of my siblings (including me) and all of my pets is that all of our first names start with the letter J and all of our middle names all start with the letter A. 
e<br><br>

        Currently in my professional life, Iâ€™m a sales manager for Vector Marketing and have been working with them since January 2020. Eversince, Iâ€™ve been able to develop interpersonal, sales, and management skills and have helped produce right around $880,000 by coaching a team of sales representatives. Because of Vector Marketing, my life has positively been impacted and hence has led me to grow exponentially within these passed 2 years both professionally and personally. Iâ€™m planning on seeking more internships for both this coming fall/winter and next summer. This summer, I am opening my own branch for Vector Marketing and am aiming at producing $300,000 in revenue. The biggest reason that Iâ€™d like to do this is to have enough money to pay off my next year in college without having to work throughout the school year. Second, I couldnâ€™t imagine how many doors would be opened up to me after throwing that onto my resume. My biggest goal in college is to make sure that I can stand out from the rest of the college students to ensure I get a well paying job right out of college. My biggest fear as well is not being able to attain a well paying job within my major. Iâ€™d really hate to spend all this time and education just to end up at a minimmum wage job earning $15 an hour.
